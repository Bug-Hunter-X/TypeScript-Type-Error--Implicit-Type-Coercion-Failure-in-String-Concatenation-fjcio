This code demonstrates a common TypeScript error related to type safety and implicit type coercion during string concatenation. The `combineStrings` function is designed to concatenate two strings. However, passing a number (123) as the first argument leads to a type error because TypeScript's type system prevents implicit coercion of a number to a string in this context. The solution involves explicit type checking or conversion of the inputs to ensure they are strings before concatenation.
